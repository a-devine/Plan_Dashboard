## For GitHub Deployment (2 minutes)

You have a GitHub repository already? Great! Here's what to do:

### Step 1: Get Your Repository URL
What's your GitHub repository URL? It should look like:
```
https://github.com/yourusername/repo-name
```

### Step 2: Simple Web Upload (Easiest!)

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.com
2. Click "Add file" → "Upload files"
3. Drag and drop `index.html` from this folder
4. Commit the file
5. Go to Settings → Pages
6. Enable GitHub Pages (Source: main branch)
7. Done! Your tool will be live in 1-2 minutes

### Step 3: Access Your Tool
Your tool will be available at:
```
https://[username].github.io/[repo-name]/
```

## Using the Tool

### First Time Setup (One-time)
1. Open the tool in your browser
2. Click "Update Intelligence (Optional)"
3. Upload your Past POs (F4311) file from JDE
4. Intelligence builds and saves automatically
5. Click "Export Intelligence Data" to create a backup

### Daily Use (Every time)
1. Open the tool → Intelligence loads automatically
2. Upload your Buying Sheet
3. Click "Generate Planning Dashboard"
4. Review, decide, add notes
5. Export your work

### Quarterly Maintenance (Every 3-6 months)
1. Export fresh F4311 data from JDE
2. Upload to "Update Intelligence"
3. Export the new intelligence file for backup

## What Files Do You Need?

### One-Time:
- `index.html` - The tool itself (upload to GitHub)

### For Using the Tool:
- **Buying Sheet** - Upload daily/weekly (CSV or Excel)
- **Past POs (F4311)** - Upload once, refresh quarterly (CSV or Excel)

## Browser Storage Note

The tool saves intelligence data in your browser's localStorage. This means:
- ✅ Works offline after first load
- ✅ Data persists between sessions
- ✅ Fast loading
- ⚠️ Data is per-browser (export to use on different computers)
- ⚠️ Clearing browser data = intelligence lost (export backups!)
